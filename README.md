# QtDraw

3D drawing tool for molecules and crystals based on [PyVista](https://docs.pyvista.org/) and [Qt](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt5/#).
Drawings are associated with crystallographic symmetry operations provided by [MultiPie](https://github.com/CMT-MU/MultiPie).

## Installation

QtDraw can be installed from PyPI using pip on Python >= 3.8:
```
pip install qtdraw
```
It is useful to associate with the following application with `.qtdw` extension.
- [Mac](https://github.com/CMT-MU/QtDraw/tree/main/others/QtDraw_MacApp.zip)
- [Windows](https://github.com/CMT-MU/QtDraw/tree/main/others/QtDraw_WinApp.zip)

You can also visit
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/qtdraw/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/CMT-MU/QtDraw) to download the source.
