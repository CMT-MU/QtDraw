# [QtDraw](https://cmt-mu.github.io/QtDraw/)

3D drawing tool for molecules and crystals based on [PyVista](https://docs.pyvista.org/) and [Qt](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt5/#).
Drawings are associated with crystallographic symmetry operations provided by [MultiPie](https://github.com/CMT-MU/MultiPie).

- **Installation**: QtDraw can be installed from PyPI using pip on Python >= 3.9:
    ```
    pip install qtdraw
    ```
    - It is useful to associate with the following application with `.qtdw` and `.cif` extension.
